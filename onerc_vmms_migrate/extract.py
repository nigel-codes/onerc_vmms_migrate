"""Everything the migration needs from the old site, as plain dictionaries.

`extract(source)` is the only function that touches the old database. What it
returns — a `snapshot` — is JSON-able and is what `transform` reads, so the
transform is pure and can be tested against a hand-written snapshot.

Field lists name what the mapping uses. A field this particular prod site does
not have comes back as None (see `Source.select`), and `profile` reports which
ones were missing so that a gap is seen before it is loaded.
